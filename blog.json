            "blog_description": "Rayquaza is a long, green, serpentine Pok\u00e9mon with yellow eyes. It has pink lining in the mouth. It has yellow, linked, circular markings down its entire body. In Mega form, it has a Delta-shaped jaw on its mouth, yellow energy \"ribbons\", and an elongated serpent body. As Mega Rayquaza, it is more aggressive and powerful.As a natural ability, Rayquaza can float and control the speed, direction and altitude of its levitation. Despite not having used any of these characteristics in battle throughout its appearances in the anime, all Rayquaza have sharp claws on their hands, sharp teeth and a powerful constrictor body. It's not known if Mega Rayquaza can use its energy whips/tentacles as weapons or if they are simply regular body parts. Naturally, given it can travel through the ozone layer safely and even higher layers of Earth's atmosphere, it demands very little air to live and possibly none. If none, it could possibly travel through space, since the layer that intermediates the Ozone layer and the troposphere can hit -60 \u00b0C or -76 F. If the belief that Rayquaza is responsible for destroying meteors still in the higher atmospheric layers is true, it would have to be able to endure temperatures that can reach -100 \u00b0C, or even -148 F. It shows that Rayquaza have a great resistance to cold, which is ironic since it has double weakness to Ice typing. Despite its resistance, it is not known if Rayquaza can endure the -270 \u00b0C or -454 F of the absolute vacuum of space.",
